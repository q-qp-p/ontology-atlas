/**
 * **One face for the three states** where conversation is not yet possible —
 * browser (app only), no folder, no key.
 *
 * ## Why the chat shape is shown in advance
 *
 * The old empty state was one title line plus one sentence, with most of the panel
 * below it an empty black area. Two things fail at once: ① the fact that this is
 * **a place you converse in** is not on screen, so there is no telling what
 * entering a key gets you, and ② an empty slab reads as an "unfinished" signal. So
 * the composer's position is drawn in advance at the bottom — a dashed border
 * already means "a slot not yet filled" in this app (the studio's sockets).
 *
 * ## No traps are built
 *
 * An input field that only imitates one becomes a trap that does nothing when
 * pressed. So this position is **a single control**: the whole dashed row is a
 * button (or link), and the pill inside it names the destination. No disabled
 * button is drawn, and every visible control really works. The explanation block
 * carries no button, so the entrance to the same feature is not duplicated — there
 * is one way in, the composer's position.
 *
 * ## Empty space — the mass is not moved but **anchored at both ends**
 *
 * The old layout stood the block **centred** vertically. Measured at 1512×950, the
 * empty space split into 361px above and 361px below, and neither meant anything —
 * a position that is neither top nor bottom explains nothing.
 *
 * Pinning the whole thing to the bottom was not the answer either (measured: one
 * 656px mass above). The total whitespace does not shrink at this width and height —
 * all that can be decided is **where the whitespace is and what it means**.
 *
 * So one mass is split in two and anchored at both ends:
 *
 * - **Top** = this place's value — "here is what you can ask for" plus sentences
 *   drawn from this folder. The value arrives where reading begins.
 * - **Bottom** = what it costs to use that value, plus the door to it. Directly
 *   above where the hand goes (the composer strip).
 * - **The gap between** = where the conversation will appear. After sending, an
 *   answer really does sit there, so this whitespace is not emptiness but
 *   **anticipation**.
 *
 * The order (value → cost) is as before, and now that order is true of **position**
 * as well as of the sentences.
