/**
 * The **wiring** behind "picking a project opens the map inside it".
 *
 * ⚠️ `resolve-picked-vault-folder.test.ts` already holds the rule itself, but a correct rule nobody
 * calls changes nothing. This file covers the part that was untested when the feature shipped: that
 * `open()` actually consults it, opens the folder it names, registers **that** folder as the vault,
 * and reports the substitution so a screen can say so.
 *
 * Everything here is deliberately at the seam. It mocks the desktop bridge rather than the resolver,
 * so a regression that stopped calling the resolver — or called it and ignored the answer — fails
 * here rather than passing on the strength of the pure test next door.
