Decides which of a repository's documents are worth quoting, pulls the headings and excerpts that say something, and downgrades trust when a document reads like marketing or an unfilled template.

## Includes
- Document discovery, per-document heading and excerpt extraction inside a fixed character budget, using authored Markdown while excluding fenced and indented code blocks, blockquotes and HTML comment/container content.
- Initial document rows expose selected-prose omissions and the first omitted physical line; the next bounded source read is guarded by the original SHA-256. Truncated excerpts require claim review and hostile-instruction precedence remains intact.
- A risk scan that flags negated, future-tense or deprecated prose and holds it back as review-only.

## Excludes
- Accepting a quoted sentence as true; every excerpt stays candidate evidence.
- Executing or rendering anything it reads.

## Uncertainty
- Read from the module header and the packet this repository's own scan returned, which flagged one audit document for negated claims. How the risk heuristics behave on prose in other languages was not checked.
