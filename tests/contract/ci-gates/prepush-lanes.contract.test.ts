/**
 * The pre-push hook is a **fast, path-scoped mirror of CI** — this locks the four
 * properties that make it survivable, because losing any one of them is what
 * killed the previous version.
 *
 * ## The history this encodes
 *
 * The first hook ran `checks:changed --run` over the whole pushed range, serially.
 * On a 1,536-file branch that was **657 checks, 40 minutes for 35 of them** —
 * twelve hours against CI's eight minutes. It was deleted (ledger 94), then
 * restored in Buzz's shape (ledger 95) after finding that `block/buzz` — the
 * project this repository benchmarks against — does ship one, built from
 * glob-filtered parallel lanes with e2e left to CI.
 *
 * The predecessor of this file (`local-ci-parity.contract.test.ts`) had already
 * written the failure mode down: *"one route took over 10 minutes to open. At that
 * point a person switches the hook off. And the moment it is switched off, this
 * hook may as well not exist."* It was right, so what is pinned here is speed
 * structure, not command parity.
