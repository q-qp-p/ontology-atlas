 * tool name in them does not exist, the agent stops at that line and the user digs
 * through their own configuration, never suspecting the sentence we handed them.
 *
 * So the names are **compared against the MCP server's real tool list** — the server
 * source is the source of truth, not a second list we maintain by hand (a duplicate
 * starts drifting immediately).
 *
 * Two unusable things are blocked alongside: skills that exist only in our repository
 * (`/ontology-*`) and `npx ontology-atlas`, which is not in the registry. Both are
 * 404s in a user's environment.
