 * Connection doctor — **the checks Rust returns and the copy the screen knows
 * must match.**
 *
 * Failure here is silent. Add a check in Rust without copy and the screen gains
 * **one blank row** with no error. Delete a check but keep the copy and dead
 * strings survive, translated. Neither is visible to the next person.
 *
 * And the worst defect in this feature is **claiming something is repairable and
 * then doing nothing when pressed**: the screen is believed to have stated a
 * fact, and the user is misled twice. So this also checks that `REPAIRABLE_IDS`
 * is a subset of `CHECK_IDS`.
