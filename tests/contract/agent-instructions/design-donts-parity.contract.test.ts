/**
 * **There is one authoritative list of design Don'ts** — copies are subsets, and
 * they are matched by slug.
 *
 * ## Why this gate exists (2026-08-05 design-system audit)
 *
 * The same "absolute rules" list lived in **three places** and **no two of them
 * agreed**:
 *
 * | | Items | Something it had that others lacked |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `docs/DESIGN-SYSTEM.md` | 14 | floating-box soup · stacked popovers · allowing overlap |
 * | `.claude/rules/forbidden.md` | 9 | — |
 * | `.claude/rules/design.md` | 8 | the glow boxShadow ring |
 *
 * And there was **no gate** reconciling them. `design.md` was missing the label
 * arrow and the card height — **both already backed by contract tests** — so a
 * copy was behind the spec and nobody knew. The discipline this repository wrote
 * down for skill copies had never been applied here: *"With two copies and no gate,
 * drifting is the default"* — CLAUDE.md.
 *
 * ## Why slugs are compared rather than sentences
 *
 * `documentation.md` pins the rule: **never check a sentence a human wrote.** The
 * three files differ in language (Korean/English) and in detail — trying to match
 * sentences would ① fail because translations differ and ② break every time a
 * document is rewritten more clearly. So each item carries a `<!--dont:slug-->`
 * and this check looks at **the slug set only**. Sentences are free; slugs are the
 * contract.
 *
 * ## What is enforced
 *
 * 1. The authoritative list is not empty (a gate over an empty set is not a gate).
 * 2. Every slug in a copy exists in the authoritative list — a **subset**, not an
 *    equal set. `forbidden.md` is loaded every turn, so it deliberately carries
 *    fewer. Adding is free; only **writing something not in the authoritative
 *    list** is blocked.
 * 3. No slug is duplicated within one file.
 * 4. `design.md` points rather than lists — it must carry 0 slugs.
