     *    picked a vault sees the **sample vault**, and that document exists **only in
     *    the dogfood vault**. The result was a screen that returned **200 and opened
     *    nothing**, which is harder to notice than a 404.
     *
     * So the rule was narrowed: when the guide needs to point at a vault document it
     * sends the reader **to GitHub** (external links are out of this check's scope).
     * That always opens for a first-time visitor.
